## Description

This project is a demonstrative Telehealth application designed to showcase the capabilities of an AI-powered chatbot for assisting users with various health-related tasks. The AI chatbot will act as a virtual assistant, interacting with users through a chat modal on the page.

The key functionalities the AI chatbot will support include:

Symptom Triage: The chatbot will help users assess their symptoms and provide basic guidance on potential health concerns.
Scheduling Appointments: Users will be able to schedule appointments with physicians, streamlining the process for both patients and healthcare providers.
Ordering Prescriptions: The chatbot will facilitate prescription orders by interacting with the necessary medical data to ensure accuracy.
Retrieving Patient Information: The chatbot will provide users with relevant and personalized patient data, making it easier for them to track and manage their health.
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how an AI agent can interact with available data in the application and use tools like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance its ability to respond to user queries. By utilizing RAG and other AI tools, the chatbot will be able to pull information from external sources, such as medical databases or user data, and use it to generate more accurate and context-aware responses.

This project aims to showcase the integration of AI agents in healthcare applications, highlighting their potential for improving user experience, enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems, and supporting patients in managing their health needs remotely.
